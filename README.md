RECOMMENDATION.

Health is an important factor that contributes into happiness score, hence African countries needs to invest in their health sector because A healthier life equals an happier life.
As a Nigerian and Afriacn, i would recommend the government of most African countries come together and implement strict rules on corruption that will help reduce the way at which the government officials steal public funds meant to be used for the growth and development of the country.  
They also need to improve their economy by making more exports, grow more agricultural products that will attract foreign investors and tackle insecurity to promote more international visits.
